    title: Config type
    description: >-
      You must choose an installation method. Most users should choose the
      normal mode, but more advanced users will be able to customize the
      installation of the node and its environment variables. The methods are:


      **Normal** (Recommended): You will fast-sync and run an Ethereum full node.
      You will be able to broadcast transactions to the network and use it normally
      as your main node.


      **Archive** (NOT Recommended): An Archive node downloads and stores every
      state. It is **NOT** recommended unless you want to query the node for
      very specific informatin or for research purposes. 


      **Advanced** (NOT Recommended): You will be able to select different
      parameters and configure them at will. Please refer to the
      [documentation](https://nethermind.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html)
      for further explanation.


      **Custom** (NOT Recommended): This mode needs a configuration file (.cfg) that will load
      particular settings. This allows you to use this client to set up a custom config, do not use this setting unless you are an advanced user and know exactly what you're doing, making the wrong change can break your whole Dappnode.
      You can find examples of .cfg files
      on [Nethermind's
      Github](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/tree/master/src/Nethermind/Nethermind.Runner/configs).

      If set to ‘true’ then in the Fast Sync mode blocks will be first downloaded from the provided PivotNumber downwards. This allows for parallelization of requests with many sync peers and with no need to worry about syncing a valid branch (syncing downwards to 0). You need to enter the pivot block number, hash and total difficulty from a trusted source (you can use etherscan and confirm with other sources if you wan to change it). default value: false

      If set to `true` then in the Fast Blocks mode Nethermind generates smaller requests to avoid Geth from disconnecting. On the Geth heavy networks (mainnet) it is desired while on Parity or Nethermind heavy networks (Goerli, AuRa) it slows down the sync by a factor of ~4 default value: true
